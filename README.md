    What if everything was priced at 995? Or 9.95? or 99.5? This is a shop that dares to do so.

### Built With

- [Astro ðŸš€](https://astro.build/)
- [Vue](https://astro.build/)
- [SnipCart](https://snipcart.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Why?

Two reasons.

1) Support consumerism.
2) Try out the new Astro framework. Although unfortunately I don't really push the whole concept of island architecture with what I built. It was still fun learning the quirks of Astro and I'd like to really push the island architecture concept with future projects.
